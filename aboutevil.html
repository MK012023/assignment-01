                In my role as a Forensic Psychometrist, I have been tasked with assessing facets of the human psyche
                that relate to psychopathy, recidivism, risk, malingering and other stuff. While all living humans
                possess some element of dangerousness, there are few, if any, that possess the callous disregard for
                human life that the infamous Hank Scorpio demonstrates. When combined with his propensity for violence,
                the venerable Mr. Scorpio is often classified as the most heinous man alive by the top military brass
                around the world. Well, just in Canada actually. This page states just the facts about Hank Scorpio. As
                such, the content is upsetting and graphic in nature. Proceed only with a great measure of caution.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have read and assessed the most risky and violent offenders not just from Canada but from all over the
                world. This includes narcissistic, anti-social, and psychopathic individuals, however none of the people
                come even close to the monstrous nature of Hank Scorpio. The CEO and owner of Globex Corporation, Hank
                is the dashing and debonair face of pure evil!
            </p>
            <p>
                While Mr. Scorpio, with his rugged good looks and chiseled jawbone, may not initially seem like the most
                dangerous man alive, his attractive exterior hides the dastardliest of evils. What, you may ask, is
                this risk? His charisma and his callous disregard for others creates an evil that no human can resist.
                This is demonstrated when Hank casually asks others to kill for him, to which they joyfully attack
                government intruders, demonstrating the depth of his evil influence. And it appears that no one is
                immune to his charm, making him the most influential, and handsome, individual of all time.
